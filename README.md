# AI-Recruiting-Agent
to help us create an AI Recruiting agent using Relevance AI technology. This agent will help us find and recruit candidates and set up interviews on my calendar for follow-up chats about the job openings.

The AI agent will:
Researches prospects and generates value hypotheses
Personalizes outreach and handles questions & objections
Books meetings and updates CRM

===================
Python script for building an AI Recruiting Agent using Relevance AI or similar technologies. This script covers core functionalities, including candidate research, personalized outreach, interview scheduling, and CRM updates.
Python Code Implementation
1. Import Required Libraries

import requests
import json
import datetime
from calendar_integration import create_calendar_event  # Placeholder for calendar integration

2. Relevance AI Integration

You can replace Relevance AI endpoints with equivalent functions if using another platform.

RELEVANCE_AI_API_URL = "https://api.relevanceai.com"
RELEVANCE_AI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

def search_candidates(query, filters=None):
    """
    Search for candidates based on specific requirements using Relevance AI.
    """
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {RELEVANCE_AI_API_KEY}"}
    payload = {
        "query": query,
        "filters": filters or {}
    }
    response = requests.post(f"{RELEVANCE_AI_API_URL}/search", json=payload, headers=headers)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        print("Error searching candidates:", response.text)
        return None

3. Candidate Outreach with Value Hypotheses

def generate_value_hypothesis(candidate_profile):
    """
    Generate a value hypothesis for a candidate based on their profile.
    """
    return f"We noticed your experience in {candidate_profile['industry']} and your expertise with {candidate_profile['skills']}. We think you'd be a great fit for our team working on {candidate_profile['potential_project']}."

def send_personalized_email(candidate_email, subject, body):
    """
    Send a personalized email to the candidate.
    """
    print(f"Sending email to {candidate_email}...")
    # Email sending logic (e.g., using SMTP, SendGrid, or other services)
    return True

4. AI Outreach Handling Objections

from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

chatbot = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.7)

def handle_candidate_questions(candidate_question):
    """
    Use AI to handle candidate questions and objections.
    """
    prompt = f"""
    You are an AI recruiting assistant. Respond to the candidate's question or objection effectively and professionally:
    Question: {candidate_question}
    """
    return chatbot.predict(prompt)

5. Schedule Meetings

def schedule_interview(candidate_name, candidate_email, date_time):
    """
    Schedule an interview on the calendar and notify the candidate.
    """
    event_details = {
        "title": f"Interview with {candidate_name}",
        "description": f"Follow-up chat regarding job opportunities.",
        "start_time": date_time,
        "attendees": [candidate_email],
    }
    event = create_calendar_event(event_details)
    return event

6. Update CRM

CRM_API_URL = "https://your-crm.com/api"
CRM_API_KEY = "YOUR_CRM_API_KEY"

def update_crm(candidate_profile, stage):
    """
    Update CRM with the candidate's profile and progress stage.
    """
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {CRM_API_KEY}"}
    payload = {
        "candidate_id": candidate_profile["id"],
        "name": candidate_profile["name"],
        "email": candidate_profile["email"],
        "stage": stage,
        "updated_at": datetime.datetime.now().isoformat(),
    }
    response = requests.post(f"{CRM_API_URL}/update", json=payload, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f"CRM updated for {candidate_profile['name']}.")
    else:
        print("Error updating CRM:", response.text)

7. Orchestrator Function

def ai_recruiting_agent(job_description, scheduling_availability):
    """
    Main function to orchestrate AI recruiting tasks.
    """
    # Step 1: Search for candidates
    candidates = search_candidates(query=job_description)
    if not candidates:
        print("No suitable candidates found.")
        return
    
    for candidate in candidates["results"]:
        print(f"Evaluating {candidate['name']}...")
        
        # Step 2: Generate value hypothesis
        hypothesis = generate_value_hypothesis(candidate)
        print(f"Value Hypothesis for {candidate['name']}: {hypothesis}")
        
        # Step 3: Send personalized outreach email
        email_body = f"""
        Hi {candidate['name']},
        
        {hypothesis}
        
        We'd love to discuss this opportunity further. Please let us know your availability for a follow-up chat.
        
        Best regards,
        AI Recruiting Agent
        """
        send_personalized_email(candidate["email"], "Exciting Opportunity", email_body)
        
        # Step 4: Handle any questions or objections (mock interaction)
        question = "What are the working hours?"  # Example question
        response = handle_candidate_questions(question)
        print(f"AI Response to Candidate: {response}")
        
        # Step 5: Schedule an interview
        interview_time = scheduling_availability[0]  # Example: pick the first available slot
        event = schedule_interview(candidate["name"], candidate["email"], interview_time)
        print(f"Interview scheduled: {event}")
        
        # Step 6: Update CRM
        update_crm(candidate, stage="Interview Scheduled")

How to Run the Script

    Prerequisites:
        Obtain API keys for Relevance AI, your CRM system, and email sending service.
        Integrate with your calendar (e.g., Google Calendar API) via the create_calendar_event function.

    Run the Main Function:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    job_desc = "Senior Python Developer with experience in AI and recruitment tools"
    availability = ["2024-12-01T10:00:00", "2024-12-02T14:00:00"]  # Example availability slots
    ai_recruiting_agent(job_desc, availability)

Next Steps

    Testing:
        Test the agent with real candidate profiles and API credentials.
    Deployment:
        Deploy on a cloud server (e.g., AWS, GCP) for continuous operation.
    Expand Functionality:
        Add chat interfaces (e.g., WhatsApp, Slack) for real-time communication.
        Implement analytics dashboards to visualize recruitment performance.

This script lays the groundwork for a fully functional AI Recruiting Agent!
